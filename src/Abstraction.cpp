/* Abstraction */

// There are two common types of Abstraction which are Data Abstraction and
// Control Abstraction, where both are used to hide information that is not
// needed to be known when using a method or class. Data Abstraction shows only
// important information about data and hides unecessary information from the
// user's perspective. Control Abstraction hides code details and provides code
// blocks or functions to use in an application.
