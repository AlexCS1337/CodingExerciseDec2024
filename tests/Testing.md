### Testing in C++

Testing is crucial in software development to ensure that code functions correctly and meets requirements. Here are some common types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests**
    - **Purpose**: Test individual units or components of the code, such as functions or classes, in isolation.
    - **Advantages**: Fast execution, easy to write and maintain, helps in identifying bugs early.
    - **Disadvantages**: May not catch integration issues, requires mocks/stubs for dependencies.
    - **When to Apply**: During development, especially when writing new functions or classes.
    
2. **Integration Tests**
    - **Purpose**: Test the interaction between different units or components to ensure they work together.
    - **Advantages**: Catches issues with component interactions, validates data flow between modules.
    - **Disadvantages**: Slower than unit tests, more complex to set up.
    - **When to Apply**: After unit testing, when integrating different components.

3. **System Tests** 
    - **Purpose**: Test the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets specified requirements.
    - **Advantages**: Validates the entire system, ensures end-to-end functionality.
    - **Disadvantages**: Time-consuming, complex testing environment.
    - **When to Apply**: Before releasing the software, after integration testing.

4. **Acceptance Tests**
    - **Purpose**: Verify that the software meets business requirements and is ready for delivery.
    - **Advantages**: Ensures the software meets user expectations, often involves user input.
    - **Disadvantages**: Can be subjective, time-consuming.
    - **When to Apply**: Before final delivery, after system testing.

5. **Regression Tests**
    - **Purpose**: Ensure that new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionality.
    - **Advantages**: Prevents new bugs from being introduced, ensures software stability.
    - **Disadvantages**: Can become extensive and time-consuming as the software grows.
    - **When to Apply**: After any code changes, during continuous integration.
